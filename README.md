# Recurrence
This repository contains the corresponding python notebooks for my Blog recurrence-reviewed.de.  
I am trying to adress both people with a strong mathematical background but without prior experience in neural networks, as well as people with less experience in mathematics but already basic knowledge of neural networks.  
If you have ideas on how to improve or find errors as well as when you are missing out something please feel free to contact me.
When you have a strong interest there is also the option to get an account for a demonstration on my jupyterlab server.

## 01 Inroduction to Neuron Models
This notebook starts with the abstraction of a singel neuron, gives a basic introduction on how to model a neuron and continues with the mathematics behind feed-forward structures and a minimal python implementation. If you ever have programmed neuron layers or a whole network yourself, you can skip this chapter.
