# Recurrence
From my Bachelor on I was interested in biological-plausible artificial intelligence (AI). 
I approached the field of AI from a perspective highly influenced by computational neuroscience and hence I focused a lot on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are ubiquitous when you look into biological structures.
Still, from my personal perspective, there is a large gap to bridge from present biological mechanisms to a broad application in current AI applications and the variety of RNN structures used in current research has not yet arrived in everyday datascience.
Several research groups work on the abstraction and transfer of biological principles in RNNs to their technical implementation and during my Master I started reimplementing and partly reproducing those studies.
The knowledge I gained on this field I would like to share with you by describing the ideas and principles on an abstract level while implementing them in python.  
Here you will find a set of python notebooks which start at the basics of RNN architectures (especially for those, who only used abstract interfaces like Keras so far). We start from the biological perspective, continuing with the dynamics of single recurrent units up to the implementation of advanced recurrent architectures including principles like intrinsic plasticity and local active information storage:

## 01 Primer to recurrent neural networks
This notebook starts with the abstraction of a singel neuron, gives a basic introduction on how to model a neuron and continues with the mathematics behind feed-forward, as well as recurrent structures. If you ever have programmed neuron layer or a whole network yourself, you can skip this chapter.

I am trying to adress both people with a strong mathematical background but without prior experience in neural networks, as well as people with less experience in mathematics but already basic knowledge of neural networks.  
If you have ideas on how to improve or find errors, as well as when you are missing out something please feel free to contact me.
When you have a strong interest there is also the option to get an account for a demonstration on my jupyterlab server.
