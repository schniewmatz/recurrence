# Recurrence
This repository contains the corresponding python notebooks for my Blog recurrence-reviewed.de.

## 01 Primer to recurrent neural networks
This notebook starts with the abstraction of a singel neuron, gives a basic introduction on how to model a neuron and continues with the mathematics behind feed-forward, as well as recurrent structures. If you ever have programmed neuron layer or a whole network yourself, you can skip this chapter.

## 02 

I am trying to adress both people with a strong mathematical background but without prior experience in neural networks, as well as people with less experience in mathematics but already basic knowledge of neural networks.  
If you have ideas on how to improve or find errors, as well as when you are missing out something please feel free to contact me.
When you have a strong interest there is also the option to get an account for a demonstration on my jupyterlab server.
